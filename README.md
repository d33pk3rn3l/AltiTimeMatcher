# AltiTimeMatcher
A small, user-friendly program designed to identify the lift-off point in an unreferenced altimeter time series of the AIR-ETH GPR platform. It then adds the timestamp of lift-off utilizing the GNSS Time from an IMU File. Additionally, it fills in any missing timestamps by employing the sampling frequency.
